        downloadthe restored file from the Clumio UI. The email (`email`) option allows
        users to accessthe restored file using a downloadable link they receive by
        email. If a target is notspecified, then `target` defaults to `direct_download`.

    {}`. if a target is not specified, then `target` defaults to
    `direct_download`.

    Specifies a download link (accessible via emails) as the restore target. if not

            Preview:
    Determines whether the query is preview only. if `true`, a preview of the

    if `false` or omitted, a task will be queued to make results
    of the query available for asynchronous download.

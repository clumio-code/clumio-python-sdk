    """Implementation of the 'CreateAwsConnectionV1Request' model.

        Attributes:
            AccountNativeId:
    The aws-assigned id of the account associated with the connection.

            AwsRegion:
    The aws region associated with the connection. for example, `us-east-1`.

            Description:
    The user-provided description for this connection.

            OrganizationalUnitId:
    The clumio-assigned id of the organizational unit associated with the
    aws environment. if this parameter is not provided, then the value
    defaults to the first organizational unit assigned to the requesting
    user. for more information about organizational units, refer to the
    organizational-units documentation.

            ProtectAssetTypesEnabled:
    The asset types enabled for protect.
    valid values are any of ["ec2/ebs", "rds", "dynamodb", "ec2mssql", "s3", "ebs",
    "icebergonglue", "fsx"].

    note -
    1. ec2/ebs is required for ec2mssql.
    2. ebs as a value is deprecated in favor of ec2/ebs.

            ServicesEnabled:
    The services to be enabled for this configuration. valid values are
    ["discover"], ["discover", "protect"]. this is only set when the
    registration is created, the enabled services are obtained directly from
    the installed template after that. (deprecated as all connections will have
    both discover and protect enabled).

        The minimum frequency between backups for this SLA. Also known as the recovery
        point objective (RPO) interval.For example, to configure the minimum frequency
        between backups to be every 2 days, set `unit="days"` and `value=2`.To configure
        the SLA for on-demand backups, set `unit="on_demand"` and leave the `value`
        field empty.

        Attributes:
            Offsets:
    The weekday in decimal of the weekly sla parameter. valid values are integers from 0 to 6, incidates sunday, monday, ..., saturday. for example, to configure backup on every monday, set `unit="weekly"`, `value=1`, and `offsets={1}`.

            Unit:
    The measurement unit of the sla parameter.

    The measurement value of the sla parameter.

    """Implementation of the 'ReadFileSystemResponse' model.

        Attributes:
            Links:
                Hateoascommonlinks are the common fields for hateoas response.

            Available:
                The amount of available memory on the filesystem in bytes. does not include
    reserved memory.

            FilesystemNativeId:
                The filesystem uuid produced by the `lsblk` linux command. if this filesystem
    was not given a uuid in the host environment, then this field has a value of
    `null`.

            Id:
                The clumio-assigned id of the filesystem.

            IndexingFailedReason:
                The reason why file indexing failed. if file indexing succeeded, then this field
    has a value of `null`. possible values include "unsupported" and "encrypted".

            IsEncrypted:
                Determines whether the file system was encrypted.

            IsIndexed:
                Determines whether the file system has been indexed.
    if `true`, file indexing completed successfully.

            MountPath:
                The location of this filesystem in the host environment. only identifies mount
    points that correspond to windows drive letters. all other mount points are
    identified by a '/'.

            NumFilesIndexed:
                The number of files (including directories) indexed in the file system.

            Size:
                The total amount of memory available to the filesystem in bytes.

            Type:
                The type of the filesystem. this field is populated with values returned from
    the lsblk command. possible values include `ntfs`, `xfs`, and `ext3`.

            Used:
                The amount of memory used by the filesystem in bytes.

        this field is omitted from the response.

        Attributes:
            AlternativeReplica:
    The alternative replica for mssql database backups. this setting only applies to availability group databases. possible values include `"primary"`, `"sync_secondary"`, and `"stop"`. if `"stop"` is provided, then backups will not attempt to switch to a different replica when the preferred replica is unavailable. otherwise, recurring backups will attempt to use either the primary replica or the secondary replica accordingly.

            PreferredReplica:
    The primary preferred replica for mssql database backups. this setting only applies to availability group databases. possible values include `"primary"` and `"sync_secondary"`. recurring backup will first attempt to use either the primary replica or the secondary replica accordingly.

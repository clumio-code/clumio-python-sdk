        Attributes:
            DayOfMonth:
    The day of the month when the report will be sent out. this is required for the 'monthly'
    report frequency. it has to be >= 1 and <= 28, or '-1', which signifies end of month.
    if the day_of_month is set to -1 then the report will be sent out at the end of every month.

            DayOfWeek:
    Which day the report will be sent out. this is required for 'weekly' report frequency.

            Frequency:
    The unit of frequency in which the report is generated.

            StartTime:
    When the report will be send out. this field should follow the format "hh:mm" based
    on a 24-hour clock. only values where hh ranges from 0 to 23 and mm ranges from 0 to
    59 are allowed.

            Timezone:
    The timezone for the report schedule. the timezone must be a valid location name from
    the iana time zone database. for instance, it can be "america/new_york", "us/central",
    "utc", or similar. if empty, then the timezone is considered as utc.

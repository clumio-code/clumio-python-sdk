    The access options for this restored file. users can access the restored file in
    one of two ways, depending on the option selected by the user who generated the
    restored file. the direct download (`direct_download`) option allows users to
    directly download the restored file from the clumio ui. the email (`email`) option
    allows users to access the restored file using a downloadable link they receive by
    email.

            BackupId:
    The clumio-assigned id of the backup associated with this restored file.

            BackupTimestamp:
    The timestamp of the when the backup associated with this file started.
    represented in rfc-3339 format.

            ExpirationTimestamp:
    The timestamp of when the restored file will expire. represented in rfc-3339

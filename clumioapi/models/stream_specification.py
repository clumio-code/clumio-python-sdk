            Enabled:
    Indicates whether dynamodb streams is enabled (true) or disabled (false)
    on the table.

            ViewType:
    When an item in the table is modified, viewtype determines what information
    is written to the stream for this table. valid values for viewtype
    are:

    keys_only - only the key attributes of the modified item are written
    to the stream.

    new_image - the entire item, as it appears after it was modified, is
    written to the stream.

    old_image - the entire item, as it appeared before it was modified,
    is written to the stream.

    new_and_old_images - both the new and the old item images of the item
    are written to the stream.

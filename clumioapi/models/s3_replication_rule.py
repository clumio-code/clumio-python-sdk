class S3ReplicationRule:
    """Implementation of the 'S3ReplicationRule' model.

        Specifies which Amazon S3 objects to replicate and where to store the replicas.

        Attributes:
            DeleteMarkerReplication:
                Specifies whether amazon s3 replicates delete markers.

            Destination:
                Specifies information about where to publish analysis or configuration results.

            ExistingObjectReplication:
                Configuration to replicate existing source bucket objects.

            Filter:
                A filter that identifies the subset of objects
    to which the replication rule applies.

            Id:
                A unique identifier for the rule (max 255 characters).

            Priority:
                The priority indicates which rule has precedence whenever
    two or more replication rules conflict.

            SourceSelectionCriteria:
                A container that describes additional filters for identifying
    the source objects that you want to replicate.

            Status:
                Specifies whether the rule is enabled.

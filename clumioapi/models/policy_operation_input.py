class PolicyOperationInput:
    """Implementation of the 'PolicyOperationInput' model.

        Attributes:
            ActionSetting:
    Determines whether the protection policy should take action now or during the specified backup window.
    if set to `immediate`, clumio starts the backup process right away. if set to `window`, clumio starts the backup process when the backup window (`backup_window_tz`) opens.
    if set to `window` and `operation in ("aws_rds_resource_aws_snapshot", "mssql_log_backup", "ec2_mssql_log_backup")`,
    the backup window will not be determined by clumio's backup window.

            AdvancedSettings:
    Additional operation-specific policy settings. for operation types which do not support additional settings, this field is `null`.

            BackupAwsRegion:
    The region in which this backup is stored. this might be used for cross-region backup.

            BackupWindow:
    The start and end times of the customized backup window. use of `backup_window` is deprecated, use `backup_window_tz` instead.

            BackupWindowTz:
    The start and end times of the customized backup window. use of `backup_window` is deprecated, use `backup_window_tz` instead.

            Slas:
    The service level agreement (sla) for the policy. a policy can include one or more slas. for example, a policy can retain daily backups for a month each, and monthly backups for a year each.

            Timezone:
    The timezone for the operation. the timezone must be a valid location name from the iana time zone database.
    for instance, "america/new_york", "us/central", "utc".

            Type:
    The operation to be performed for this sla set. each sla set corresponds to one and only one operation.
    refer to the policy operation table for a complete list of policy operations.

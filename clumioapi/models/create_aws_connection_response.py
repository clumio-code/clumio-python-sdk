class CreateAWSConnectionResponse:
    """Implementation of the 'CreateAWSConnectionResponse' model.

        Attributes:
            Links:
    Urls to pages related to the resource.

            AccountName:
    The alias given to the account on aws.

            AccountNativeId:
    The aws-assigned id of the account associated with the connection.

            AwsRegion:
    The aws region associated with the connection. for example, `us-east-1`.

            ClumioAwsAccountId:
    Aws account id of the clumio control plane.

            ClumioAwsRegion:
    Aws region of the clumio control plane.

            Config:
    The consolidated configuration of the clumio cloud protect and clumio cloud discover products for this connection.
    if this connection is deprecated to use unconsolidated configuration, then this field has a
    value of `null`.

            ConnectionGroupId:
    Clumio assigned id of the associated connection group.

            ConnectionManagementStatus:
    Management status of connection.

            ConnectionStatus:
    The status of the connection considering all the deployments made for it.

            CreatedTimestamp:
    The timestamp of when the connection was created.

            DataPlaneAccountId:
    Aws account id of the data plane for the connection.

            DeploymentType:
    The deployment method with which the currently active connection was established.

            Description:
    The user-provided description for this connection.

            Discover:
    The configuration of the clumio discover product for this connection.
    if this connection is not configured for clumio discover, then this field has a
    value of `null`.

            ExternalId:
    Clumio assigned external id of the connection or of the associated connection group.

            Id:
    The clumio-assigned id of the connection.

            IngestionStatus:
    Status denoting whether ingestion has started for the connection.
    valid values are "initial", "in_progress", "failed", "completed".

            Namespace:
    K8s namespace.

            OrganizationalUnitId:
    The clumio-assigned id of the organizational unit associated with the
    aws environment. if this parameter is not provided, then the value
    defaults to the first organizational unit assigned to the requesting
    user. for more information about organizational units, refer to the
    organizational-units documentation.

            Protect:
    The configuration of the clumio cloud protect product for this connection.
    if this connection is not configured for clumio cloud protect, then this field has a
    value of `null`.

            ProtectAssetTypesEnabled:
    The asset types enabled for protect.
    valid values are any of ["ec2/ebs", "rds", "dynamodb", "ec2mssql", "s3", "ebs",
    "icebergonglue", "fsx"].

    note -
    1. ec2/ebs is required for ec2mssql.
    2. ebs as a value is deprecated in favor of ec2/ebs.

            Resources:
    .

            RetiredStackArn:
    The amazon resource name of the stale cloudformation stack when the connection was migrated to connection groups.
    note - this has to be removed from aws as well to delete the connection completely.

            ServicesEnabled:
    The services to be enabled for this configuration. valid values are
    ["discover"], ["discover", "protect"]. this is only set when the
    registration is created, the enabled services are obtained directly from
    the installed template after that. (deprecated as all connections will have
    both discover and protect enabled).

            StackArn:
    The amazon resource name of the installed and active cloudformation stack(if any) in aws.

            StackName:
    The name given to the installed and active cloudformation stack(if any) in aws.

            TargetSetupStatus:
    Status denoting whether target setup has started for the connection.
    valid values are "initial", "in_progress", "failed", "completed".

            TemplatePermissionSet:
    .

            Token:
    The 36-character clumio aws integration id token used to identify the
    installation of the cloudformation template on the account. this value
    will be pasted into the clumiotoken field when creating the
    cloudformation stack.

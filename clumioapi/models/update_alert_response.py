class UpdateAlertResponse:
    """Implementation of the 'UpdateAlertResponse' model.

        Attributes:
            Embedded:
    Embedded responses related to the resource.

            Etag:
    The etag value.

            Links:
    Urls to pages related to the resource.

            Cause:
    The issue that generated the alert. each cause belongs to an alert type.

            ClearedTimestamp:
    The timestamp of when the alert was cleared, either automatically by clumio or manually by a clumio user.
    represented in rfc-3339 format. if this alert has not been cleared, then this field has a value of `null`.

            ConsolidatedAlertId:
    The clumio-assigned id of the consolidated alert associated with this individual alert. alerts are consolidated based on matching parent entity, alert type, and alert cause.

            Details:
    Additional information about the alert.

            Id:
    The clumio-assigned id of the individual alert.

            Notes:
    A record of user-provided information about the alert.

            ParentEntity:
    The parent object of the primary entity associated with or affected by the alert. for example, "aws_environment" is the parent entity of primary entity "aws_ebs_volume".

            PrimaryEntity:
    The primary object associated with or affected by the alert. examples of primary entities include "aws_connection", "aws_ebs_volume".

            RaisedCount:
    The number of times the alert has recurred for this primary entity.

            RaisedTimestamp:
    The timestamp of when the alert was raised. represented in rfc-3339 format.

            Severity:
    The alert severity level. values include "error" and "warning".

            Status:
    The individual alert status. an individual alert that is in "active" status is one that is still open and has yet to be addressed.
    an individual alert that is in "cleared" status is one that has been cleared, either automatically by clumio or manually by a clumio user.

            Tags:
    A list of associated objects for the alert.

            Type:
    The general alert category. some alert types may be associated with multiple causes.
    refer to the alert type table for a complete list of alert types.

            UpdatedTimestamp:
    The timestamp of when the alert was last updated. represented in rfc-3339 format.
    the alert is updated whenever there is a new occurrence of the same alert within the same entity.

class ReadEc2InstanceResponse:
    """Implementation of the 'ReadEc2InstanceResponse' model.

        Attributes:
            Embedded:
    Embedded responses related to the resource.

            Links:
    Urls to pages related to the resource.

            AccountNativeId:
    The aws-assigned id of the account associated with the ec2 instance.

            AwsAz:
    The aws availability zone in which the ec2 instance resides. for example,
    `us-west-2a`.

            AwsRegion:
    Determines whether the ec2 instance has been deleted. if `true`, the instance has
    been deleted.

            BackupStatusInfo:
    The backup status information applied to this resource.

            DeletionTimestamp:
    The timestamp of when the instance was deleted. represented in rfc-3339 format.
    if this instance has not been deleted, then this field has a value of `null`.

            DirectAssignmentPolicyId:
    The clumio-assigned id of the policy directly assigned to the entity.

            EnaSupport:
    Enasupport indicates whether the elastic network adapter (ena) is enabled for the
    instance.

            EnvironmentId:
    The clumio-assigned id of the aws environment associated with the ec2 instance.

            HasDirectAssignment:
    Determines whether the table has a direct assignment.

            Id:
    The clumio-assigned id of the ec2 instance.

            InstanceNativeId:
    The aws-assigned id of the ec2 instance.

            IsDeleted:
    Determines whether the ec2 instance has been deleted. if `true`, the instance has
    been deleted.

            IsSupported:
    Determines whether the ec2 instance is supported for backups.

            LastBackupTimestamp:
    The timestamp of the most recent backup of the ec2 instance. represented in
    rfc-3339 format. if the instance has never been backed up, then this field has a
    value of `null`.

            LastSnapshotTimestamp:
    The timestamp of the most recent snapshot of the ec2 instance taken as part of the
    ec2 snapshot manager. represented in rfc-3339 format. if the instance has never
    been backed up, then this field has a value of `null`.

            Name:
    The aws-assigned name of the ec2 instance.

            OrganizationalUnitId:
    The clumio-assigned id of the organizational unit associated with the ec2 instance.

            ProtectionInfo:
    The protection policy applied to this resource. if the resource is not protected, then this field has a value of `null`.

            ProtectionStatus:
    The protection status of the ec2 instance. possible values include "protected",
    "unprotected", and "unsupported". if the ec2 instance does not support backups,
    then this field has a value of `unsupported`. if the instance has been deleted,
    then this field has a value of `null`.

            State:
    Pending, running,
    terminated, stopped, stopping, shutting-down, rebooting.

            SubnetId:
    The aws subnet id of the ec2 instance.

            Tags:
    The aws tags applied to the ec2 instance.

            Type:
    Https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsec2/latest/userguide/instance-types.html.

            UnsupportedReason:
    The reason why protection is not available. if the volume is supported,
    then this field has a value of `null`.

            VpcId:
    Aws-assigned id of the vpc associated with the ec2 instance.
